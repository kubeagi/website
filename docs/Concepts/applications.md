An application is a CR of type Application, where spec.nodes specifies the components involved in the application, each of which is a CR. Different types of components belong to different types of groups, such as prompts.prompt.arcadia.kubeagi.k8s.com.cn å’Œ chain.arcadia.kubeagi.k8s.com.cn.

Components of the same type, specifically different types are distinguished by kind, e.g. LLMChain and APIChain.

### Runtime

* arcadia-controller main functions:

Verify that the fields of these CRDs are valid, e.g. a CR must be present if it is referenced.

Static detection, e.g. the nodes of this application can't be in a ring, e.g. there can't be more than one Output, there must need to be a node whose next node is an Output.

* arcadia-apiserver main functions:

Instantiate the application and start executing it on a choreographed basis, actually calling the application through langchaingo, sending requests to the LLM, and returning the results.
